1. Rename the file `example.env` to `.env` by running the command:

   Alternatively, you can rename the file manually.

2. Update TELEGRAM_USER_ID, BEARER_TOKEN and API_TOKEN in the .env file

3. Install the required Node modules by running the command:

   ```npm install ```
   
4. Start the application by running the command:

   ```node index.js```

That's it! You should now be up and running.

5. Run the ```node index.js``` every 17 minutes or create a cron job that will execute every 17 minutes
